title: RAG System for Brazilian Criminal Law Research
description: "Designed and delivered an end-to-end RAG system for Brazilian criminal law research, enabling efficient retrieval and synthesis of legal precedents from multiple courts (STF, STJ, TRF4). Built a full-stack solution combining automated web scraping, semantic search with FAISS and OpenSearch, and a responsive chat interface using Nuxt 4 and Vue 3. The platform supports RAG-enhanced and direct LLM queries via a production-ready FastAPI service, focusing on scalability, performance, and legal research accuracy."
